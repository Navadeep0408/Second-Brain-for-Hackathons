# Second-Brain-for-Hackathons

## Problem
Hackathon teams often fail not because of lack of ideas, but because of lack of clarity.
Teams struggle with scope creep, too many features, and unclear execution plans under extreme time pressure.
There is no quick tool that helps teams decide what to build first — and what to avoid.

## Solution 
Second Brain for Hackathons helps teams dump messy ideas and instantly get a structured execution plan.
It focuses on clarity, scope reduction, and demo readiness rather than feature overload.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
Backend: Flask (Python)  
AI (Conceptual / Optional): OpenAI API  
Deployment: Static hosting / Local server

## AI Tools Used
OpenAI (used for idea structuring and execution planning during development and testing).

## Prompt Strategy Summary 
We used structured prompting to:
- Convert unstructured ideas into step-by-step plans
- Identify unnecessary features
- Prioritize demo-critical tasks

Prompts were designed to act like a hackathon mentor rather than a generic chatbot.

## Setup Instructions 
1. Clone the repository
2. Open index.html in a browser
3. Enter any hackathon idea
4. Click “Fix My Plan” to view structured output

## Final Output
The application outputs:
- A clear execution roadmap
- Suggested focus areas
- A list of tasks to start immediately
